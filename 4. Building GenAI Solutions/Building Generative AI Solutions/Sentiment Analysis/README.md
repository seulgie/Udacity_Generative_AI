# Exercise
In this exercise, we'll 
- use one of LangChain's built-in loaders to load fictional TV reviews from a CSV file,
- and use an LLM to perform sentiment analysis on the reviews
- we'll classify reviews into positive and negatives
- and use Pydantic parser to parse LLM output directly into Python objects
